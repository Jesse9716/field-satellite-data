# Field Satellite Data
Code written to visualize sea surface temperature data at all field sites utilized by members of Dr. Sarah Cohen's marine lab at San Francisco State University. Data utilized comes from NOAA's ERDDAP data server.

# Using the code
This script was written to teach lab members how to visualize continuous abiotic data gathered from NOAA's satellites. Many of their research projects focus on climate change and warm freshwater input from the San Francisco Bay. The .ipynb file was written in Google Collab which is very beginner friendly but can be opened in Jupyter Notebook/Lab. Each section of the code has been broken up into multiple annotated kernals so users can follow along.

# ERDDAP
ERDDAP is a data server that gives you a way to download subsets of gridded and tabular scientific datasets: [https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html]
